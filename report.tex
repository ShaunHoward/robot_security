\begin{abstract}
This paper proposes the use of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in order to take multiple
noisy input measurements from multiple robots and determine the location of a terrorized 
mobile robot in the view angle of the others. Further, an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is put 
to the test in place of the EKF to compare results between the two filters based on the 
same simulation including one moving, terrorized robot and two stationary robots that watch it. The simulation proves
that both the EKF and UKF are viable solutions for correcting terrorized odometry data for at least one robot when
grouped with a squadron of at least one additional robot.

Most current robot systems are designed in terms of functionality but little focus is put
on the security of the devices. Terrorists can easily inject perturbed data into insecure mobile
robot systems using the on-board networking utilities. The purpose of performing such a terrorist attack 
is usually to cause the robot to enter a danger zone or collide with objects that could damage or destroy it.
Given a terrorized robot monitoring its position with only a Microsoft Kinect 3D camera and a squadron of N-1
non-terrorized robots with sensors monitoring the position of the terrorized robot, an EKF or UKF can be employed to
help correctly determine the position of that Nth robot given $N$ < $2$ sensor measurements from all robots combined.

\end{abstract}
 The idea behind the method is derived from the method proposed in [1]. Their method uses an EKF to predict the
position of one terrorized robot given N sensor measurements. The difference between the methods is that this
method analyses the usage of an EKF as well as UKF for estimating the position of a terrorized robot
given N-1 measurements from remote sensors and a single sensor measurement given point cloud data from the affected robot.
Both filters show remarkable results in tracking the terrorized robot's position over time, but the UKF beats the EKF in accuracy most of the time. The simulation uses three robots with one terrorized and monitored by the other two to test the estimation hypothesis and prove that UKF works with one-dimensional robot position estimation from N noisy sensor measurements.

\section{Introduction}
Autonomous mobile robotic systems have gained prevalence in the past 10 years. Along with this
growth in usage, terrorist attacks have become more frequent on such systems.
Many current autonomous mobile robot systems are prone to attack given the wireless interfaces present
on the robots in order to send and receive communications from a command base. Increased attention has
been given to this area in recent years, but many methods still fail to recognize that a chain of robots
maybe become terrorized at once.
\par
Not only do robots have to deal with noise from their sensors, but they also are prone to loss of communications
with their remote global positioning systems (GPS). As demonstrated in [2], terrorists use a spoofed GPS system
to knock a yacht off course. Terrorist attacks are a growing threat that must be addressed in order to save
valuable robotic systems from danger zones. Figure 1 displays three TurtleBots in the Gazebo simulator world. The middle TurtleBot is the terrorized robot that moves back and forth between the other two, safe robots which monitor it as it moves. As the middle robot undergoes attack, the proposed system should provide the terrorized robot with a reasonable position estimation for safe navigational purposes such as avoiding danger zones in an environment or on a map.
\par 
Figure 1 is a reference for the simulation experiments performed in this paper. The proposed method takes
interest in estimating the state of the moving terrorized robot according to the distances between the robots acquired through point cloud scans of all the robots.

  \caption{Three TurtleBots on a world-based grid world attempt to estimate the position of the moving and terrorized robot.}
\end{figure}
\par
Importantly, redundancy is considered by utilizing N-1 sensor readings from other robots in addition to the
sensor on the moving robot in order to estimate the state of moving robot in the world. Problems such as the one posed in this paper can be solved by EKFs and UKFs. EKFs can be applied to many other cyber-physical systems that utilize multiple sensor measurements to make a prediction about the position a system.
\par
This paper contributes (1) slight modifications to the ROMDP algorithm proposed in [1], (2) a proposed technique
to deal with up to N-1 terrorized robots each with sensors measuring their own and other robot locations
using ROMDP paired with a particle filter, and (3) simulation and experimental results important to evaluate
the usability of this method in real-world scenarios considering mobile robots with monitoring allies.
\par
Following, the paper is organized like so: Section 2 describes work related to the method proposed; Section 3
formally defines the problem being investigated; Section 4.1 covers the details the ROMDP algorithm and any
modifications made; Section 4.2 details the generic particle filter algorithm; Section 4.3 outlines the positional
state estimation technique proposed using ROMDP and the generic particle filter; Section 5 covers the
simulation outline, process and experimental results of a robot with terrorized sensors and 2 non-terrorized
co-operatives. Lastly, section 6 concludes the paper and future work is discussed.
